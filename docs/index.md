features:
  - title: 🔐 Security Made Simple
    details: Terrarium hardens your VPS automatically. Your apps sit in a private network, safe from internet noise and random scans. You only expose what you explicitly choose to publish.
  - title: ⏪ The Built-In Time Machine
    details: Never fear a broken update again. ZFS snapshots let you roll your environments backward in small steps. Made a mistake? Just rewind. Off-site S3 backups offer total peace of mind.
  - title: 🌐 Effortless Publishing
    details: Route your apps to the web through Traefik with automatic SSL certificates. Lock down private dashboards and tools with built-in Single Sign-On (OIDC).
  - title: 🖥️ Visual Dashboards
    details: You don't have to live in the terminal. Manage your server, containers, and network traffic through beautiful, built-in web interfaces like Cockpit and the LXD UI.
  - title: 🤖 Perfect for AI Agents
    details: Give autonomous agents like OpenClaw or Hermes a real environment to work in. If they make a mess, your host stays safe, and you can instantly reset their sandbox.
  - title: 🐳 Beyond Basic Docker
    details: Run multi-service Compose stacks, databases, and background workers in isolated LXC containers instead of tangling everything together on your host OS.

    <h2>One server. Total isolation. Zero stress.</h2>
    <p>
      Managing a server shouldn't require a PhD in systems engineering. Terrarium is built for tech enthusiasts who want the power of a dedicated VPS without the anxiety of breaking it. Every app, AI agent, or development environment gets its own isolated container. The host stays pristine, and recovery is as easy as clicking "undo".

    <p class="terrarium-eyebrow">The Terrarium Difference</p>
    <ul class="terrarium-checklist">
      <li><strong>Mistake-proof:</strong> If an agent breaks an environment, step back through automated snapshots instead of starting over.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean organization:</strong> Keep complex databases, Redis caches, and web workers neatly bundled inside a single private container.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure access:</strong> Host a browser-based IDE or internal dashboard and protect it with enterprise-grade Single Sign-On with just a label.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

## Safety by Default

The best part of Terrarium isn't just what it can do—it's how safe it feels to use.

By default, your containers are not exposed to the internet. They live on a private network managed by Terrarium. This means:
- Random internet bots can't scan or poke at your internal services.
- A database listening on `0.0.0.0` inside a container is still entirely private.
- You can run complex, multi-tier applications and only expose the specific web frontend you want people to see.

It's advanced security without the complex configuration. You get to move fast and experiment, knowing your infrastructure is guarding your back.
