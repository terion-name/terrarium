# About Terrarium

Terrarium transforms a standard Ubuntu 24.04 VPS into a much friendlier, safer, and incredibly forgiving home for your applications and isolated environments. 

It was built to solve a very modern problem: today's AI agents, development tools, and complex self-hosted apps often need more freedom than standard Docker containers can comfortably provide. But giving them unlimited access to your host operating system is a recipe for disaster. 

Terrarium sits perfectly in the middle. It gives every workload its own fully isolated LXC container powered by a robust ZFS file system. Your host machine stays clean and secure, while you get the convenience of built-in web dashboards, automatic SSL routing, and an automated time machine to undo any mistakes.

## What Is It For?

Terrarium shines when you need to run:

- **AI Agents (like OpenClaw or Hermes):** Give them a realistic playground where they can install packages and run shell commands without risking your main server.
- **Browser-Based Workspaces:** Host cloud IDEs like VSCodium Web for seamless, anywhere access to your code.
- **Experimental Sandboxes:** Spin up temporary environments for client work or trying out new tech, then easily tear them down.
- **Complex Docker Compose Stacks:** Run multi-service apps (like a web app, database, and Redis cache) completely isolated from one another.

The goal isn't just to "run containers." It's to give your software the breathing room it needs to be useful, while ensuring your server and other apps stay completely out of the blast radius.

## Why You'll Love It

Terrarium brings enterprise-grade infrastructure features down to earth, combining them into a simple, cohesive experience:

- **True Isolation**
  Every workload lives in its own container with its own processes, packages, and filesystem. What happens in the container, stays in the container.
- **Private-by-Default Security**
  By default, containers sit behind a private network. Just because a database is running doesn't mean it's exposed to the internet. You explicitly choose what to publish.
- **The Built-In Time Machine**
  Terrarium takes automated ZFS snapshots of your environments. If an update breaks or an agent deletes something important, you don't have to rebuild. Just rewind.
- **Disaster Recovery Ready**
  Go beyond the local machine. With built-in S3 exports, you can back up your snapshots off-site so your data is safe even if the entire VPS is destroyed.
- **Visual Management**
  Say goodbye to memorizing endless command-line arguments. Terrarium includes beautiful web UIs (Cockpit, the LXD dashboard, and Traefik) so you can manage your server visually.

Terrarium is designed for tech enthusiasts who want the flexibility of a full server without having to become full-time DevOps engineers just to keep things secure and recoverable.
