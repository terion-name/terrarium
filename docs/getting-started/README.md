### 🗺️ Recommended Path

To get off to the best start, we recommend following these steps:

1. **Plan your storage:** Decide if your provider allows you to attach a separate block volume (highly recommended for performance and backups). 
2. **Pick a domain:** Decide whether you want to use your own custom domain or rely on Terrarium's automatically generated `traefik.me` domains.
3. **Choose your login method:** Decide if you want to use Terrarium's built-in local identity provider (ZITADEL) or bring your own (like Google, GitHub, or Auth0).
4. **Install:** Run the automated setup script.
