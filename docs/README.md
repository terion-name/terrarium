# Terrarium Docs

Terrarium turns a plain Ubuntu 24.04 VPS into a secure home for isolated environments, with a built-in time machine.

It is built for the way people actually use agents and development tools now: giving software enough freedom to be useful, without giving it the whole host. Agent systems like OpenClaw, Hermes, browser-based editors, internal dashboards, and temporary development environments can run inside real LXD containers on ZFS, while the host stays hardened and recoverable.

That gives you three things at once:

- isolation, so one workload does not become everyone else's problem
- a built-in time machine, so a broken environment can be stepped backward instead of rebuilt
- easy publishing, so containerized web apps can be exposed through Traefik with TLS and optional OIDC protection

And if you enable S3 exports, that time machine is not limited to the local disk. You also get an off-host disaster-recovery path for the day the whole VPS disappears.
